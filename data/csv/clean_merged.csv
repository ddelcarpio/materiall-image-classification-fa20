Established trees in the backyard yield an abundance of apricots, both navel & mandarin oranges, apples, lemons, and curry leaves. The front yard provides plenty of land in full sun and well amended with organic matter for those who wish to garden or it can be converted into the proverbial lawn where children freely frolic barefoot. Solar tubes bring plenty of natural light into the house, and the solar panels are owned and less than a year old. Easy access BART, Fwy 680 & 880/Convenient commute to Silicon Valley, Facebook Google & apple. AWARD WINNING MISSION SCHOOLS. Addition in the back of the house is permitted and currently used as 4th bedroom. Can be rented with separate entry or converted into a family room.
