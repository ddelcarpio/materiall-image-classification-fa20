# Data Folder

This folder contains all of the data we used in our exploration, pre-processing and model(s). We broke them down in two categories csv and json. 

To summarize: 

 - csv
 	- Files stored in the csv folder are data collected through several of the preprocessing and webscraping notebooks (which can be found in the 'code' folder). These image links were data either scraped directly from Realtor.com or extracted from the json files stored in the 'json' folder. 

 - json
 	- Files tored in the json folder were data files extracted Realtor.com using Diffbot. These files may have been referenced in several coding notebooks to aggregate and clean up image links for data collection.
